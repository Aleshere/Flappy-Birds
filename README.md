# Flappy Birds Game built with Vanilla js
*In this popular game, the player controls a bird attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.*  
*Helped by a tutorial, I recreated the whole process, including a state keeping track of the score.*

# What I have learned building this  

> Switch case to move among game states  
> A single sprite used to render multiple backgrounds (less heavy)       
> Gravity, Jump, Speed, Rotation properties  
> Freefall effect      
> Random pipes obstacles  
> Collision detection  
> Score + Best scores stored in Localstorage
